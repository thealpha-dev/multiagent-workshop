## Code Complexity Comparison

### LangChain
```python
from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor, create_react_agent
from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain_openai import OpenAI
from langchain_community.tools import WikipediaQueryRun
from langchain_community.utilities import WikipediaAPIWrapper

# Initialize the LLM
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)

# Initialize the Wikipedia tool
wikipedia = WikipediaQueryRun(api_wrapper=WikipediaAPIWrapper())
tools = [wikipedia]

# Define the prompt template for the agent
prompt_template = PromptTemplate.from_template("""
Answer the following questions as best you can. You have access to the following tools:

{tools}

Use the following format:

Question: the input question you want to answer
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: the action to take, should be one of [{tool_names}]
Action Input: the input to the action
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times)
Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question

Begin!

Question: {input}
Thought:{agent_scratchpad}
""")

# Create the agent
agent = create_react_agent(llm, tools, prompt_template)

# Create the agent executor
agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True)

# Run the agent
result = agent_executor.invoke({"input": "What is the capital of France?"})
print(result["output"])
```

### LangGraph
```python
from typing import TypedDict, Annotated, Sequence
from langchain_core.messages import BaseMessage, HumanMessage, AIMessage
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# Define the state
class AgentState(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[Sequence[BaseMessage], "The messages in the conversation"]
    next_step: str

# Define the nodes
def agent(state: AgentState) -> AgentState:
    messages = state["messages"]
    llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo")
    response = llm.invoke(messages)
    return {"messages": messages + [response], "next_step": "decide"}

def decide(state: AgentState) -> str:
    last_message = state["messages"][-1]
    if "FINAL ANSWER" in last_message.content:
        return "end"
    else:
        return "agent"

# Create the graph
workflow = StateGraph(AgentState)
workflow.add_node("agent", agent)
workflow.add_conditional_edges("decide", decide, {"agent": "agent", "end": END})
workflow.set_entry_point("agent")

# Compile the graph
graph = workflow.compile()

# Run the agent
result = graph.invoke({
    "messages": [HumanMessage(content="What is the capital of France?")],
    "next_step": ""
})
```

### AutoGen
```python
import autogen

# Configure LLM
config_list = [
    {
        "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
        "api_key": "your-api-key-here"
    }
]

# Create an assistant agent
assistant = autogen.AssistantAgent(
    name="assistant",
    llm_config={"config_list": config_list},
    system_message="You are a helpful AI assistant."
)

# Create a user proxy agent
user_proxy = autogen.UserProxyAgent(
    name="user_proxy",
    human_input_mode="NEVER",
    max_consecutive_auto_reply=10,
    code_execution_config={"work_dir": "coding", "use_docker": False},
)

# Start the conversation
user_proxy.initiate_chat(
    assistant,
    message="Write a Python function to calculate the Fibonacci sequence up to n terms."
)
```

### CrewAI
```python
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew, Process

# Create agents
researcher = Agent(
    role="Market Researcher",
    goal="Uncover valuable market insights",
    backstory="You are an expert market researcher with 15 years of experience in analyzing market trends.",
    verbose=True,
    allow_delegation=False
)

analyst = Agent(
    role="Data Analyst",
    goal="Analyze data to extract actionable insights",
    backstory="You are a skilled data analyst who can transform complex data into clear insights.",
    verbose=True,
    allow_delegation=False
)

# Create tasks
research_task = Task(
    description="Research the current market trends in the AI industry",
    expected_output="A comprehensive report on current AI market trends",
    agent=researcher
)

analysis_task = Task(
    description="Analyze the research data and identify key opportunities",
    expected_output="An analysis report highlighting key opportunities",
    agent=analyst,
    context=[research_task]
)

# Create crew
crew = Crew(
    agents=[researcher, analyst],
    tasks=[research_task, analysis_task],
    process=Process.sequential,
    verbose=2
)

# Execute the crew
result = crew.kickoff()
print(result)
```

## Conclusion

Each framework has its own strengths and ideal use cases. The choice of framework should be based on your specific requirements, development preferences, and the nature of the application you're building. For complex applications, it may even be beneficial to combine multiple frameworks, leveraging the strengths of each.

- **LangChain**: Best for general-purpose LLM applications with extensive component needs
- **LangGraph**: Best for complex, stateful workflows with conditional logic
- **AutoGen**: Best for sophisticated multi-agent conversations and code generation
- **CrewAI**: Best for intuitive, role-based multi-agent systems with explicit task assignment
